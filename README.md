#### Instructions
Following the Code Conventions and using good programming design and practices, appropriate data types, validation, etc., create an address book application, which uses a struct defined as a user-defined data type. Feel free to incorporate the various concepts covered in Chapters 1 - 13 as needed.

The struct should contain all fields related to what all people in your contacts have in common, e.g., ID, first name, last name, street address, city, state, zip, phone, e-mail, etc., i.e., include fields you would typically expect to find in an address book. Make sure all data entered by the user is appropriately validated.

The application program should use a menu system to do the functions concerning processing contacts, i.e., Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Whether you use an array or list. The idea here is if the user selected Create from the main menu, it would add a new contact, and then, add it to a single collection, e.g., an array. As far as retrieving contacts, it should be able to retrieve all contacts, including all of their data displayed in an appropriate list/table, and one or more contact's information as a result of a search, which you can also use for the Update and Delete functions. Other search and sort functions should be included as appropriate. It does need to be able to permanently store the information, e.g., to a file on the hard drive. Make sure you thoroughly test saving and retrieving the information from a file, because using pointers can make this tricky, i.e., the next time the program is run from a different system, it may not retrieve the data as expected; in other words, make sure you are saving the actual data and not just a pointer to the data. Hint: Check for the appropriate file and retrieve any data at the start if necessary, i.e., the file may not exist initially, and then, create and save the data to a file at the end ready to be retrieved the next time the program runs; in other words, you do not need to constantly save and retrieve data from a file while the program is running.

Don't forget to document everything with appropriate comments, i.e., comments at the top of each file, above each method, etc., and when you are done, copy and paste your comments and code into a single Microsoft Word document. Have only one person from your team submit the Final Project. The last submission will be the only one, which is graded. Everyone will receive the same grade, but that grade may be altered for each individual based on the Group Evaluation Form, etc.

Then, each team member must complete and submit FP1b - Group Evaluation Form, which is located in the Final module. If you do NOT submit the Group Evaluation Form, it will be counted as if you gave yourself 0%.

Please use the Final Project discussion if you have any questions, so everyone will benefit.
